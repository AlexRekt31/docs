# Custom Fonts <Badge text="field" type="warn"/>

The Custom Fonts extensions is for users to upload a .ttf, .woff, .otf, or .zip containing any of the afore mentioned 
fonts. It will then generate whatever fonts it may need, and make the font accessible via the typography field within 
Redux. A custom font CSS file will be enqueued to the panel as well as the frontend.

::: tip Getting Started
To understand how to use extensions, you should read this article on [Using Extensions](../guides/basics/using-extensions.md).
 To shortcut the process, you can use the [Redux Build](http://build.redux.io/) site. Please be aware that a working 
 knowledge of PHP and CSS is required to properly use this extension. Should you not be familiar with one or the other 
 (or both), please refer to the following guides to get you started: 
 [Getting Started with PHP](http://www.php.net/manual/en/tutorial.php), 
 [CSS Introduction](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp).

## Placement of the Custom Fonts Field
By default, the custom fonts field is added to a dynamic section at the end of your panel called Font Control. Once you 
load the extension it does all the heavy lifting.

Now with Custom Fonts 1.0.2, you can now move the field to any section you desire. You need only include one field of 
type `custom_fonts`, and custom fonts will be added wherever you specify. The dynamic section called Font Control will 
be removed. This new feature requires Custom Fonts 1.0.2+ as well as Redux 3.4.1+.
